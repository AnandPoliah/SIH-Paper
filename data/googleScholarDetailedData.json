    "description": "The present work deals with the optimization of material and machining parameters for surface finish and Material Removal Rate (MRR) enhancements while turning Aluminium/Rock dust composite through Taguchi and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). Rock dust particles weight percent (5, 10 & 15%) and particle size (10, 20 & 30 μm) are varied accordingly to investigate the effect of reinforcement parameters on composite properties. Along with reinforcement weight % and particle size, also the turning parameters viz. speed, feed and depth of cut are chosen as input parameters with surface roughness (Ra) and MRR as responses. CNC turning is performed based on the L27 orthogonal array designed by Taguchi approach. Results expose that feed has remarkable effect on Ra and MRR rather than any of the other parameters examined. The optimum parameter combination identified through Multi criteria …",

    "description": "In a quest to ensure sustainability of the future generation, various research attempts are focusing on the use of alternative materials for construction. In this study, bamboo strips were used as reinforcement in a concrete that was made with supplementary cementitious materials and partial replacement of river sand with manufactured sand (m-sand). Cement was partially replaced by 25% of combination of admixtures such as fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS). In alignment with standard requirements, concrete samples such as cubes, cylinders and beams were produced and tested at stipulated periods. Micro scale analysis was performed on the bamboo using SEM and FTIR, and its tensile strength was also determined. The results of the micro scale and tensile strength tests revealed that bamboo is a strong and ductile material. The study showed that a combination of fly ash, GGBS and m …",

    "description": "Over the  the past decade, social networking services (SNS) have proliferated on the web. The nature of such sites makes identity deception easy, providing a fast means for creating and managing identities, and then connecting with and deceiving others. Fake users are those accounts specifically created for purposes such as stalking or abuse of another user, for slander, or for marketing. The current system for detecting deception depends on behavioral, non-behavioral and user-generated content (UGC) information gathered from users. Although these methods have high detection accuracy, they cannot be implemented in databases with massive volumes of data. To address this issue, this paper proposes an enhanced graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm (EGSLA) to detect fake users from a large volume of Twitter data. The proposed method encompasses four modules: data collection …",

By using sensor nodes, various types of environmental conditions can be sensed and also it can communicate with the sensed data via wireless communication. The sensor nodes are provided with a battery, and the reduction of the power consumption may lead to the prolonged anticipation of a lifetime of sensor nodes. Researchers worked on sensor nodes to gain energy efficiency and increase its lifetime. Reliable and effective communication among nodes routing algorithms is often used for WSNs. The important objective of routing algorithms is energy saving. Clustering algorithm improves energy efficiency in Homogeneous WSNs.

Since data in motion are difficult to capture and process with existing innovation. In spite of the fact that there are numerous frameworks that have executed for user behavior analysis, it’s as yet an upcoming and unexplored market that has more prominent potential for better advancements. So with the help of Hadoop framework, a new approach of designing a communal framework is proposed and it’s used for predicting and identifying user’s behavioral analysis in a community.

    "description": "In recent decades, geopolymer concrete (GPC) has been extensively researched as a potential substitute sustainable building material that may reduce CO2 emissions due to its utilization of industrial by-products. Fly ash (FA) and ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) are preferred geopolymer raw materials due to their obtainability and high alumina and silica concentrations. GGBFS-FA based GPC offers a clean and sustainable development technology alternative. In this study, the Taguchi method was used to optimize the mixed proportions of geopolymer concrete to achieve desired strength criteria. Four factors and four levels were considered: binder content, including four combinations of FA and GGFBS dosage, dosage of superplasticizer (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2%), Na2SiO3/NaOH ratio (1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3), and molarity (6, 8, 10 and 12). Using these ingredients and factors, the effect of compressive strength was examined. The Taguchi approach using an L16 orthogonal array was employed to find the optimum condition of every factor while limiting the number of experiments. The findings indicated that the optimum synthesis conditions for maximum compressive strength obtained from the binder comprised 45% of FA, 45% of GGBFS and 10% of silica fume, 1.5% dosage of superplasticizer, Na2SiO3/NaOH ratio = 1.5, and 12 molar contents.",

Sensor nodes communicate with a base station to distribute their data for the purpose of remote process and storage.

WSNs have some tribulations on different methods such as deployment, coverage, trust model, time synchronization, middleware, fault tolerance and the rest.

Therefore, they are suitable only for temporary communication links. An important issue in computer network is to design the network in such a way to cope up with the speed required today. The task of routing the packets from a source to the particular destination in ad-hoc networks is hard because the network elements are mobile and there is no central control over the network elements. In any network, the data packets have to be routed to the destination with minimum loss, minimum delay and maximum packet delivery ratio. Therefore, there must be an efficient routing algorithm which satisfies all these quality of service requirements and it must also be robust and adaptive.

This has been considered as a major problem for quality metric and this proposes non uniformity in route path. To overcome this unstable state this paper introduces a new metric called route availability (RA). This paper proposes a new abstraction of RA as a metric for route non uniformity in a MANET and verifies how efficiently it represents the quality of service of a mobile network or the quality of experience of audio and video streaming.

The Development of the QoS constraint for routing protocol in MANET is a challenging task. As nodes are free to move randomly across mobile network, the routing protocols for MANET are prone to the node mobility. The best path has been chosen and QoS requirements are attained by the proposed routing protocol. Based on the priority allocated to the path, routing protocol estimates the bandwidth.

The data is being transmitted from source node to destination through multiple intermediate nodes ie., in a multi-hop fashion. Each node has a particular range in which the transmission takes places. When a packet is being transmitted they move from one range to the other range in the network where this may lead to packet loss due to link failure and dynamic changing nature.
