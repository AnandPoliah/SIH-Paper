    "description": "The present work deals with the optimization of material and machining parameters for surface finish and Material Removal Rate (MRR) enhancements while turning Aluminium/Rock dust composite through Taguchi and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). Rock dust particles weight percent (5, 10 & 15%) and particle size (10, 20 & 30 μm) are varied accordingly to investigate the effect of reinforcement parameters on composite properties. Along with reinforcement weight % and particle size, also the turning parameters viz. speed, feed and depth of cut are chosen as input parameters with surface roughness (Ra) and MRR as responses. CNC turning is performed based on the L27 orthogonal array designed by Taguchi approach. Results expose that feed has remarkable effect on Ra and MRR rather than any of the other parameters examined. The optimum parameter combination identified through Multi criteria …",

    "description": "In a quest to ensure sustainability of the future generation, various research attempts are focusing on the use of alternative materials for construction. In this study, bamboo strips were used as reinforcement in a concrete that was made with supplementary cementitious materials and partial replacement of river sand with manufactured sand (m-sand). Cement was partially replaced by 25% of combination of admixtures such as fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS). In alignment with standard requirements, concrete samples such as cubes, cylinders and beams were produced and tested at stipulated periods. Micro scale analysis was performed on the bamboo using SEM and FTIR, and its tensile strength was also determined. The results of the micro scale and tensile strength tests revealed that bamboo is a strong and ductile material. The study showed that a combination of fly ash, GGBS and m …",

    "description": "Over the  the past decade, social networking services (SNS) have proliferated on the web. The nature of such sites makes identity deception easy, providing a fast means for creating and managing identities, and then connecting with and deceiving others. Fake users are those accounts specifically created for purposes such as stalking or abuse of another user, for slander, or for marketing. The current system for detecting deception depends on behavioral, non-behavioral and user-generated content (UGC) information gathered from users. Although these methods have high detection accuracy, they cannot be implemented in databases with massive volumes of data. To address this issue, this paper proposes an enhanced graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm (EGSLA) to detect fake users from a large volume of Twitter data. The proposed method encompasses four modules: data collection …",

By using sensor nodes, various types of environmental conditions can be sensed and also it can communicate with the sensed data via wireless communication. The sensor nodes are provided with a battery, and the reduction of the power consumption may lead to the prolonged anticipation of a lifetime of sensor nodes. Researchers worked on sensor nodes to gain energy efficiency and increase its lifetime. Reliable and effective communication among nodes routing algorithms is often used for WSNs. The important objective of routing algorithms is energy saving. Clustering algorithm improves energy efficiency in Homogeneous WSNs.

Since data in motion are difficult to capture and process with existing innovation. In spite of the fact that there are numerous frameworks that have executed for user behavior analysis, it’s as yet an upcoming and unexplored market that has more prominent potential for better advancements. So with the help of Hadoop framework, a new approach of designing a communal framework is proposed and it’s used for predicting and identifying user’s behavioral analysis in a community. The proposed work can be applied in the community-based environment where the prediction and identification of user behavior analysis has to be made with the semantic web approach.

    "description": "In recent decades, geopolymer concrete (GPC) has been extensively researched as a potential substitute sustainable building material that may reduce CO2 emissions due to its utilization of industrial by-products. Fly ash (FA) and ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) are preferred geopolymer raw materials due to their obtainability and high alumina and silica concentrations. GGBFS-FA based GPC offers a clean and sustainable development technology alternative. In this study, the Taguchi method was used to optimize the mixed proportions of geopolymer concrete to achieve desired strength criteria. Four factors and four levels were considered: binder content, including four combinations of FA and GGFBS dosage, dosage of superplasticizer (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2%), Na2SiO3/NaOH ratio (1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3), and molarity (6, 8, 10 and 12). Using these ingredients and factors, the effect of compressive strength was examined. The Taguchi approach using an L16 orthogonal array was employed to find the optimum condition of every factor while limiting the number of experiments. The findings indicated that the optimum synthesis conditions for maximum compressive strength obtained from the binder comprised 45% of FA, 45% of GGBFS and 10% of silica fume, 1.5% dosage of superplasticizer, Na2SiO3/NaOH ratio = 1.5, and 12 molar contents.",

In mobile ad hoc network, each and every autonomous node holds displacements and shifts based on the precise positions within the network. Hence the verification of node position is crucial in mobile ad hoc networks and it is mainly a great dispute during the existence of opponents focusing on damaging the system. The intention is to design a standard termed as Adjacent Node Location Confirmation (ANLC) for confirming the location of its transmitting adjacent nodes for interchanging the messages and confirms the location of the nodes in transmission within the network. Initially, the method focuses on finding the nodes …",

    "description": "Cloud computing refers to on-demand delivery of service over internet and has application in various domains like media, research, business, bigdata analysis etc. Task scheduling is one of the prime issues in this type of environment. Various metaheuristic algorithms and hard optimization problems have been proposed for solving cloud task scheduling which is a non-deterministic polynomial or an NP. Adaptation of the scheduling strategy to the changes taking place in the environment has to be done by a good scheduler. A proposal for cloud scheduling by means of a balanced load using both firefly algorithm (FA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) heuristics has been made. The aim is to balance the load of the entire system while at the same time bring down the makespan of a set of tasks. This new strategy for scheduling has been simulated with CloudSim tool kit package. The results of this experiment …",

    "description": "-------------------------------------------------------------------ABSTRACT----------------------------------------------------Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network with numerous sensor nodes for examining physical situations, communication and data collection. Sensor nodes communicate with a base station to distribute their data for the purpose of remote process and storage. They are scattered, so it has some challenges and constraints in energy, design, security and more. WSNs have some tribulations on different methods such as deployment, coverage, trust model, time synchronization, middleware, fault tolerance and the rest. In this paper, we have discussed about Time Synchronization (TS) and its importance, issues, so that we can easily find the problems and propose some valuable methods to solve those issues.",

    "description": "A mobile ad-hoc network is a self configuring network connected by wireless links. No infrastructure or central administration is needed for these type of networks. Therefore, they are suitable only for temporary communication links. An important issue in computer network is to design the network in such a way to cope up with the speed required today. The task of routing the packets from a source to the particular destination in ad-hoc networks is hard because the network elements are mobile and there is no central control over the network elements. In any network, the data packets have to be routed to the destination with minimum loss, minimum delay and maximum packet delivery ratio. Therefore, there must be an efficient routing algorithm which satisfies all these quality of service requirements and it must also be robust and adaptive. The algorithm Multi Agent Ant Based Routing Algorithm is designed from the …",
